# Amplitude-Spectrum-Analysis
A physics project that envolved me creating a program in Python to analyse given data.

Due to the size of the Excel-Files (800Mb per file, 2x files), they are not uploaded here.

The Project is about data analysis. I was given a huge data set. That data was taken from cosmic radiation that fell on Belgrade over a year's time (the date when it was collected was not given to me). My task was to transform the measured data into something that was presentable and usable.

In the PDF (DRS4Project) are the results, as well as some theory, and the whole analysis part that was used (It is written on Serbian).
The Project was written in Python (3.8.0).
